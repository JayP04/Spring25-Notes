# What is a Network?

## Network Building Blocks
- **Nodes**
- **End systems**: e.g., computers, servers, printers, cell phones
- **Switches** and **routers**
- **Links**: optical fiber, coax cable, could be wireless
    - The point is to connect without interruption
    - Point to point
    - Shared media with multiple access
        - Having a main link, multiple nodes can connect to that shared link
        - If the traffic is too much, all the signals can collide with each other

## Network Definition
- A network should be scalable
- Network security is also an important component

## Internetworking
- **Connecting networks**
    - **Router**: a specialized node that connects between networks
        - Router has functionalities that include addressing mechanisms to share the data
    - **Switches**: local network

## Addressing and Routing
- **Address**: byte string that identifies a node or a network
    - 4 bytes = 32 bits → identifies the node
    - Different IPs for different networks → represents the location of the network
- **Routing**: determining the path that packets between two nodes follow

## Address Types
- **Unicast**: one to one
- **Multicast**: one to many
- **Broadcast**: one to all

## Network Protocols
- **Human protocols**:
    - "What's the time?", "I have a question"
- **Computer network protocol**:
    - Once a connection request is made, a connection response is expected
    - Using the method of choice, the respective action is taken and sent back
    - Protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission and receipt
