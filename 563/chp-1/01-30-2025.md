### example

- 1gb/s link 
    - i.e. 10 ^ 9 bits/sec

- for each user, active 10% of time --> p = 1/10 = 0.1
    - 100 mb/s when active
        - 100 x 100^6 bit/sec

- total users = 35

- calculate probability where number of active users are > 10 

- P( X = 11) + p( X = 12) .. + p( X = 35)

-  this is a binomial distribution
    - (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

first term of the equation
- n = 35
- K = 11

second term of the equation
- n = 35
- k = 12

till last term of the equation
- n = 35
- k = 35



## Performance: Delay, loss, throughput

### delay in packet switching network
- Dproc: Nodal Processing
    - processing time router takes to do sanity checks
    - all the bits that are arriving gets checked by the router
    - its very small delay

- Dque: Queuing delay
    - time waiting to be transmitted on link
    - its a very complex theory 


- Dtrans: Transmission delay
    - packets have L bits (length)
    - Transimission rate is R 
    - amount of time taken to push all the bits of the packet onto the link

    - example
        - R = 1.5 mbps are being put on the wire every second
        - L = 1500 bits
        - L/R = 1500/1.5 * 10^6 = 10^-3 sec = 1 millisecond
        - this is the time taken to push all the bits of the packet onto the wire

- Dprop: Propagation delay
    - this is the delay that is cuase by the distance between the nodes, the amount of time taken by data to propogate from one node to another
    - distance between the nodes is d
    - propagation speed is s ( ~ 2 * 10^8 m/s)
    - d/s


### Packet loss 

- packet queuing and loss
    - if the packets are arriving at a rate that is greater than the rate of the link, then the packets will be queued in the router
    - if the queue is full, then the packets will be dropped

- Recovery

### "Real" internet delays and routes
- traceroute: 
    - program that can be used to measure the delay between two nodes
    - it sends 3 probes to the first route and then will check the delay, then keeps exapnding the route to the destination


### Throughput
- the amount of data transferred / time taken
- instantaneous throughput: rate at a given point in time
    - 
- average throughput: rate over a period of time
