# Protocol

### Protocol Stack
- **Application**
- **Transport**: Creates an end-to-end process connection between two hosts for data transfer
    - **Process**: A running program 
    - **TCP**: Provides a reliable connection
    - **UDP**: Connectionless

- Both application and transport layers lie at the network edge
- The rest lie in the network core

- **Network**: Finds the correct path (algorithm) for the data to travel between links
- **Link**: Transfers data between two directly connected nodes
- **Physical**: Transfers bits between two directly connected nodes

### Encapsulation
- From the source, the whole stack is encapsulated into a packet with the message. M is the application layer message. The transport layer adds a header to M and sends it to the network portion, which adds extra information to the header. Each layer does the same.

- When it goes to a switch, it only looks at the link and physical layers.
- When it goes to a router, it looks at the network, link, and physical layers.
    - Both switches and routers work to figure out the path and transfer of the data.
- At the destination, the message is received. At each layer, the header is unwrapped, and the message is received after the encapsulation is done.
