# Transportation layer

- at the transfer layer the packet is reffered as segment.
- at the network layer the packet is reffered as datagram.

- transport layer establishes a connection between processes of the hosts.

## Two types of transport layer protocols:

1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- services that are not available
    - delay guarantee
    - bandwidth guarantee
        - because of traffic congestion


## Trasport layer actions
- Sender side: 
    - applciation is generated and passed to the transport layer.
    - transport layer adds a header to the application data and passes it to the network layer.
       - creates a segment

- Receiver side:
    - transport layer receives the segment passed through all layers. 
    - transport layer removes the header and passes the application data to the application layer.
    - demultiplexing: process of delivering the data to the correct application.

- multiplexing: process of combining multiple data streams into a single data stream.
    - different sockets are being sent to the network driver

- at the reciever side, it is then demultiplexed
-
