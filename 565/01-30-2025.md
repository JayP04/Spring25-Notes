# Chapter 2: User Identification and Authentication

## Physical Security

- Definition: Every defense mechanism is done by the true scenario in the real world.

- Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, programs, networks, and data from physical circumstances and events that could cause serious losses or damage to an enterprise, agency, or institution.
