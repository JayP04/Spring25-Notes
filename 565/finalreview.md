### Chapter 4

#### System Security
- Understand the process of boot sequence:
    - Check if CPU and memory are ready; if not, cause an error message.
    - Find the place where the OS will be stored, so it can be loaded and started.
    - Load the boot program.
    - If not, refer to the "post again" slide.

- **Security Issues 1**
    - Understand two security issues:
        - *(Details missing)*

- **Password Salt**
    - With and without salt.
    - Search space growth.
    - Understand these two questions.

- **ACE, ACL**
    - Linux permissions:
        - Check the strategies in the "different systems" slide.
        - Linux permissions:
            - File system:
                - Groups.
                - Categories.
                - Permissions for different categories.
            - Understand the comments and how they are read. Refer to the slide with those comments.
            - There is a question somewhere around this; understand how to answer it.
    - For Windows:
        - What is the difference in security, file systems, and all?

- **Buffer Overflow Attack**
    - Understand the whole process:
        - Partition of address.
        - Permission of the shell code.
        - Partition of the malicious code.
    - Level L1 attack and lower:
        - New return address can be any from the "lob"?
        - You donâ€™t need the exact prediction, just an estimate of where to put it.
        - Process is the key part, and the "low, lob?" *(unclear)*.
        - *(No clue what was said)*.

- Done with system security.


- Tthe porcess to start OS. 
- two security issues. hybernation attack or something. 
- file systesm: liunux and windows, commens and difference. comments and reader comments.
- salting
- ACE, ACL - some concepts in file systems
- importance in buffer overflow attack
- the nop sled 



### Software Security

- **Security and Reliability**
    - How they are related and interrelated connections.
    - Reliability can't guarantee security.
        - How the attacker benefits from that.
    - Security can guarantee reliability.

- **Input Validation**
    - Exploit Unicode bug:
        - Unicode character, how `/` and similar characters matter.
        - Check examples around slides 16-18.
        - Signed integer.
        - Unsigned integer.
        - Understand computing with integers:
            - Why specific outputs occur.
            - If the number of bits for an integer is signed or unsigned, consider two cases:
                - Overflow or not.
                - How the calculations happen.
            - Know the result for each output.
            - Understand the standalone code (simple one on slide):
                - Which iteration the code will stop at.
                - How many times the loop runs or how to count the iterations.

- **SQL Injections**
    - Malicious input.
    - Expected output and related details.
    - Check the slide for examples.
    - Another example is on the differences.
    - Two categories of defense:
        - Detection.
        - Prevention (e.g., filtering).

#### Key Topics
1. Input validation.
2. Loop example (while code example).
3. Integer examples (signed, bits, and unsigned bits).
4. Concept of security and reliability:
     - Security features: detection and prevention.
     - Which feature is for what (example: mobility).
5. Determining in software.
6. Double free attack.
7. SQL injection:
     - Commands (if provided, know them accordingly).
     - Definition.
     - Ways to achieve the injection (e.g., comment-out symbol).

### Network Security

- **Attacks**
    - ARP spoofing.
    - ICMP attack.
    - SYN flood.
    - DNS.

- **Understanding Attacks**
    - Be clear on ARP, ping, smurf, SYN, session hijacking, and DNS poisoning attacks.
    - Understand how these attacks are done and their associated layers:
        - ARP: Link layer.
        - ICMP/ping/smurf: Network layer.
        - SYN, hijacking: Transport layer.
        - DNS: Application layer (working process).
            - To solve it, refer to "divssec."

- **Defense/Firewall**
    - About firewalls, positioning, goals, and different types:
        - Packet filtering.
        - Stateful.
        - Application-level.
    - Understand the differences between them.
    - Reasons why ARP, smurf, and similar attacks work.
    - Check slides on ARP spoofing:
        - Depends on the machine's trust.
    - Check other attacks as well and ensure understanding.

- **DNS**
    - Security check guaranteed by QID or something similar.
    - If the attacker guesses the QID:
        - The attack will be quicker, and the attacker's answers will be saved in the cache.
        - Otherwise, the attack will fail.
    - Two conditions for attack success:
        1. The guess is correct.
        2. The attacker's answer is faster than the legal name server's response.
    - If the attacker fails:
        - They must wait until the TTL time expires.
        - The next attack should be launched after that time.
    - Check the "DNS attack next try" slide:
        - The attacker won't need to wait.
        - Understand the process and how it works in case of failure or success.
