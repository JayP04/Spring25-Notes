# Android Hello World

### Anatomy of an Android App

- Android apps have highly articulated structure
- apps have a lot of files and compact structure
- apps structure requires parsing out lots of diff aspects of apps, many of which use diff representations.

- app is in directory
    - have manifest files XML (which declared the compnonents and their permissions)
    - code (kotlin + java)
    - resources (images, icons, media)
        - layouts (supposed to be XML defined)
        - Values (app name, colors)

### DEV

- pick what your app can run lowest on (API level)
- Ideal for this class is 28
- Based on API level, increasing order, the devices that can run the app is affected. 

- using app manifest to declare the component

- intent-filter: this is where we delcare the actions
