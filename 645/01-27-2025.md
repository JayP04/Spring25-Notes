# 2s complement, overflow

### Words in MIPS ISA
- A word is 32 bit long binary
- left most - Most Significant bit (MSB)
- Right most - Least Significant bit (LSB)

- changing the lsb has the least impact on the number
- vice versa for msb, great impact on number


    | Address | Data       |
    |---------|------------|
    | 1  | 0 x 00 |
    | 2  | 0 x FF |
    | 3  | 0 x 27 |


- the sign of the number is determined by the MSB
- the rest of the bits are the magnitude (value) of the number

| Binary | Decimal |
|--------|---------|
| 000   | 0       |
| 001   | 1       |
| 010   | 2       |
| 011   | 3       |
| 100   | 0|
|101|-1|
|110|-2|
|111|-3|

- two's complement 
    - -> 1. invert all bit  
    -> 2. add 1 to the result


### Convert 2's complement to decimal

- the sign bit  (MSB) is multiplied by -2^31
- the rest of the bits are multiplied with positive base


### convert to negative in 2's complement

- should be done in atlesat 4 bits

    1. Invert all bits
    2. Add 1 to the result

- this doesnt work for minimum integer value
- since the negative range is larger then positive, it cannot be done.
